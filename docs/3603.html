The API style that you choose should complement the solution you're trying to build and not the other way round.</span><span id="483d" class="lo lp iq lk b gy lu lr l ls lt">I honestly can't say much on when to use each style but then making proper research and knowing what your business needs should help out.</span><span id="113b" class="lo lp iq lk b gy lu lr l ls lt">An <strong class="lk ir">API</strong> endpoint is the point of entry in a communication channel when two systems are interacting.</span><span id="9571" class="lo lp iq lk b gy lu lr l ls lt">A <strong class="lk ir">REST API</strong> is an API that has different endpoints, doing different things.</span><span id="196c" class="lo lp iq lk b gy lu lr l ls lt"><strong class="lk ir">GraphQL</strong> doesn’t have an endpoint for different things but just one endpoint, you just tell the single endpoint what you want in a graphql query language.</span><span id="52ed" class="lo lp iq lk b gy lu lr l ls lt">The difference between both is: a <strong class="lk ir">REST API</strong> is always going to return the same type of data if you give the endpoint the same parameter whereas a <strong class="lk ir">GraphQL query</strong>, even though you only want a very specific amount of data, you just ask for that specific amount of data.<br/> <br/>The big difference is that <strong class="lk ir">REST APIs</strong> have many endpoints while <strong class="lk ir">GraphQL</strong> has just one endpoint.</span><span id="9537" class="lo lp iq lk b gy lu lr l ls lt">Other types of APIs in the past we’ve had <strong class="lk ir">SOAP</strong> but those are a thing of the past unless you’re working in a more matured industry like Banks and other financial institutions where you’re working with technologies that are 10-15 years old. Choosing any of these <strong class="lk ir">APIs</strong> depends on what exactly you want to do. REST is my personal favorite, by the way, I’m still <strong class="lk ir">RESTing😅</strong></span><span id="7767" class="lo lp iq lk b gy lu lr l ls lt">Lastly, REST and GRAPHQL aren’t things you <strong class="lk ir">`npm install graphql/rest`</strong> or <strong class="lk ir">`yarn install graphql/rest`</strong> but they are certain methodologies as to how you want things to be structured. It’s not a piece of software that you go out and build but a way you tackle things.</span><span id="a896" class="lo lp iq lk b gy lu lr l ls lt">In the next steps, my focus is going to entirely be on building RES<strong class="lk ir">T APIs</strong> because that's what i'm mostly familiar with but i'll drop links down below for further reading on both <strong class="lk ir">GraphQL and REST.</strong></span></pre><p id="3278" class="pw-post-body-paragraph jy jz iq ka b kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv ij bi translated"><strong class="ka ir"> 2。设置服务器💻</strong></p><pre class="lf lg lh li gt lj lk ll lm aw ln bi"><span id="5c9b" class="lo lp iq lk b gy lq lr l ls lt">Now you have to make use of a server that is going to accept the request whether a <strong class="lk ir">REST</strong> request or <strong class="lk ir">GraphQL</strong> request, do the work and return a response. You can do this in any language out there but being a javascript developer, I’d probably reach for Express, that is what I personally run all my own endpoints from. <strong class="lk ir">Koa</strong> seems to be a pretty popular server for specifically creating <strong class="lk ir">APIs</strong>.</span><span id="087c" class="lo lp iq lk b gy lu lr l ls lt">The thing about Express is that you’re going to need to reach out to middlewares for doing things like authentication or rate-limiting or even blacklisting.</span><span id="d4c4" class="lo lp iq lk b gy lu lr l ls lt">The beauty of Express is that for almost everything that you need there’s almost some sort of <strong class="lk ir">middleware</strong> or <strong class="lk ir">plugin</strong> that someone has written that will just immediately add all of that functionality to any of your requests. And of course, you can use any language you want to create an <strong class="lk ir">API</strong>, you could use Laravel if you write PHP, Ruby on Rails. Any server out there that can accept a request and return a response can be used to make an <strong class="lk ir">API</strong>.</span></pre><p id="623c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph jy jz iq ka b kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv ij bi translated"><strong class="ka ir"> 3。弄清楚如何正确命名API端点😓</strong></p><pre class="lf lg lh li gt lj lk ll lm aw ln bi"><span id="8771" class="lo lp iq lk b gy lq lr l ls lt">Naming things is one of the hardest parts of software development, it is quite difficult for developers to correctly name things. I generally like to use a noun for my API endpoints, never use a verb. There's a website called <a class="ae lv" href="https://restfulapi.net/resource-naming/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">RestfulAPI</a>, it has a whole page for best practices in naming <strong class="lk ir">APIs. </strong>It's easy to name APIs at first but when things get complicated it becomes quite difficult and messy. This is where <strong class="lk ir">GraphQL</strong> becomes advantageous and better than <strong class="lk ir">REST APIs</strong>, you don't need to create various endpoints with various names. You have just one endpoint doing everything.</span></pre><p id="823a" class="pw-post-body-paragraph jy jz iq ka b kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv ij bi translated"><strong class="ka ir"> 4。编写解析器/控制器✍️ </strong></p><pre class="lf lg lh li gt lj lk ll lm aw ln bi"><span id="3b8a" class="lo lp iq lk b gy lq lr l ls lt">This is where we make things happen, I like to call it resolvers or controllers and this is where the actual work happens. <br/>When someone uses your API they are CRUD-ing (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Now when someone hits any of your API endpoints you need to do the work either looking up stuff in the database, authentication, saving data to a DB that's what I'd call a resolver. It gets the data, updates the data and send back to the user with a code to show the user what happened, these codes are called <strong class="lk ir">Http</strong> <strong class="lk ir">Response Code</strong>.</span></pre><p id="5f81" class="pw-post-body-paragraph jy jz iq ka b kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv ij bi translated"><strong class="ka ir"> 5。找出如何保护它，防止它从恶意攻击❌ </strong></p><pre class="lf lg lh li gt lj lk ll lm aw ln bi"><span id="39f4" class="lo lp iq lk b gy lq lr l ls lt">The first point of securing your API is ensuring traffic is only allowed via https. There are a couple of ways you can secure an API also one of the simplest forms of security is to only accept requests from logged-in users, so that could be a cookie session, a JWT or you can use AUTH which is sort of complex. Other ways are to provide API keys for people accessing your APIs and also a random id so that you can track the number of requests that goes through that API key. You can use CORS(Cross-origin Resource Sharing), which means whether the API should be accessible in the browser or is it to be accessed on the server. There’s also keeping the access level of your users in mind, make sure only admin level users can have access to every user information.<br/>Protecting your <strong class="lk ir">API</strong> is not necessarily the same thing as securing your API but it’s along the same lines though, you’d want to protect your servers, computers that are serving up this data from all sorts of malicious and intentionally and unintentionally threats. One of the things you can do is to rate limit by <strong class="lk ir">API key</strong> or by <strong class="lk ir">IP Address</strong>, so if somebody is doing something more than usual you can tell the user to chill for a while and try again or else you won’t serve the data again.</span></pre><p id="d737" class="pw-post-body-paragraph jy jz iq ka b kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv ij bi translated"><strong class="ka ir"> 6。记录API📝</strong></p><pre class="lf lg lh li gt lj lk ll lm aw ln bi"><span id="7b1b" class="lo lp iq lk b gy lq lr l ls lt">This actually a huge thing, if you have an <strong class="lk ir">API</strong> and expect anyone to use it or even yourself, you need to document it. you have to pay close attention to how you are doing it and in my mind, the best option is to copy the people doing it well and don't try to make things up. For example, Stripe has a very good documentation, one of the best I've seen. Check it out <a class="ae lv" href="https://stripe.com/docs/api" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><strong class="lk ir">here</strong></a>.</span><span id="22fd" class="lo lp iq lk b gy lu lr l ls lt">Document what parameters, headers that can be accessed and even up to the tiniest of details. Parameters even if they aren't required. They need to be properly documented. Also, document needs to get back when someone hits a particular endpoint. You can also document your public <strong class="lk ir">API </strong>to match various languages in case your users are global, it's called <strong class="lk ir">Internalization(i8n) </strong>and <strong class="lk ir">Localization.</strong></span><span id="fa95" class="lo lp iq lk b gy lu lr l ls lt">Another thing you need to learn to put in your API documentation are the <strong class="lk ir">HTTP verbs</strong>. When you make a request in any language you can send that request as any number of different verbs, you can make a <strong class="lk ir">GET </strong>request which is used to get data from the server, a <strong class="lk ir">POST</strong> request which is used to send data to the server, <strong class="lk ir">PUT </strong>request which is used to update data and a <strong class="lk ir">DELETE </strong>request which is used to remove data.</span></pre><ul class=""><li id="d832" class="kw kx iq ka b kb kc kf kg kj ky kn kz kr la kv lw lc ld le bi translated"><strong class="ka ir">奖励:对API进行版本控制</strong></li></ul><pre class="lf lg lh li gt lj lk ll lm aw ln bi"><span id="2bad" class="lo lp iq lk b gy lq lr l ls lt">A lot of times, companies have different versions of an API because the existing structure of the current API is not going to be the same forever and many of these <strong class="lk ir">APIs</strong> give you the ability to use an older version of the API that way if you hit the API endpoint, it's not going to magically change on you. So by versioning it, it's kind of locking functionality to a given point in time.</span><span id="9dc1" class="lo lp iq lk b gy lu lr l ls lt">Companies that do this really well obviously, it's <strong class="lk ir">Stripe</strong>. <br/>Within their API docs, you can set the version of their API that you need.</span><span id="3a03" class="lo lp iq lk b gy lu lr l ls lt">Versioning API an API is an extremely important thing because it gives you the correct version of the <strong class="lk ir">API endpoint</strong> that you want to hit. It also gives library authors the ability to update and change the API, but then you don't want to go and change things often and like crazy otherwise, you will get a lot of people upset.</span></pre><p id="2fbd" class="pw-post-body-paragraph jy jz iq ka b kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv ij bi translated">延伸阅读:</p><ul class=""><li id="0f2f" class="kw kx iq ka b kb kc kf kg kj ky kn kz kr la kv lw lc ld le bi translated"><a class="ae lv" href="https://blog.back4app.com/2019/11/25/when-to-use-graphql/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">https://blog.back4app.com/2019/11/25/when-to-use-graphql/</a></li><li id="79b0" class="kw kx iq ka b kb lx kf ly kj lz kn ma kr mb kv lw lc ld le bi translated"><a class="ae lv" href="https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/engineering/what-is-api-definition-types-specifications-documentation/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">https://www . altex soft . com/blog/engineering/what-is-API-definition-types-specifications-documentation/</a></li><li id="2c14" class="kw kx iq ka b kb lx kf ly kj lz kn ma kr mb kv lw lc ld le bi translated"><a class="ae lv" href="https://www.moesif.com/blog/technical/graphql/REST-vs-GraphQL-APIs-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">https://www . moes if . com/blog/technical/graph QL/REST-vs-graph QL-APIs-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly/</a></li><li id="7ab4" class="kw kx iq ka b kb lx kf ly kj lz kn ma kr mb kv lw lc ld le bi translated"><a class="ae lv" href="https://xalitech.com/graphql-how-to-convince-your-boss/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">https://xalitech.com/graphql-how-to-convince-your-boss/</a></li><li id="c909" class="kw kx iq ka b kb lx kf ly kj lz kn ma kr mb kv lw lc ld le bi translated"><a class="ae lv" href="https://dev.to/sadarshannaiynar/graphql-or-rest-what-should-i-use-38mj" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">https://dev . to/sadarshannayinar/graph QL-or-rest-what-should-I-use-38mj</a></li><li id="bd53" class="kw kx iq ka b kb lx kf ly kj lz kn ma kr mb kv lw lc ld le bi translated"><a class="ae lv" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Introduction" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer .
